## :tshirt: About themeRec
Coding never gets bored with themeRec! :partying_face:

ThemeRec is a VS Code extension that recommends and installs a popular VS Code theme for you. Unlike existing approaches that let users explore and select the themes they like, themeRec pushes themes to users, which allows users to try more themes.

Upon installation, you will find two buttons on the leftmost on your status bar. 

Click the `refresh` button to surprise yourself! :tada:

Click the  `back` button to get the default VS Code dark theme. :upside_down_face:

## :musical_keyboard: Installation
Prerequisite:

Install [themePack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jtan.themepack) to get all the themes installed.


## :bug: Issues and contributing
Contribute to the current themeRec by:
* Report bugs
* Design your own theme
* Let us know your favorite theme

In the coming month, we will integrate a recommendation system with the current themeRec, please keep a close eye on the updates. :eyes:
